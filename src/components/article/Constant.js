        description: `JShell is a Java shell, a command-line interface for running Java code snippets. It was introduced in Java 9 as a way to interactively evaluate small pieces of Java code and get immediate feedback. JShell is a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) tool, which means that it reads a piece of code, evaluates it, prints the result, and then goes back to the read-evaluate step, until you tell it to stop.
        To start JShell, you can use the jshell command in a terminal window. Once JShell is running, you can enter Java code snippets, and they will be immediately evaluated and the results will be printed to the console. You can also use commands to control the execution of the code snippets, such as /list to list all the code snippets that have been entered, /edit to edit a code snippet, or /exit to exit the JShell session.
        JShell can be a useful tool for quickly testing out code ideas, or for learning Java by experimenting with small code snippets. It can also be used to run simple scripts, by entering a series of code snippets that depend on each other and then using the /run command to execute all of them at once.`,

            To start JShell, you can simply open a terminal or command prompt and type "jshell". This will launch the JShell REPL (read-eval-print loop), where you can enter Java code and see the results.
            One of the benefits of JShell is that you can try out small pieces of code without having to create a full Java program. For example, you can enter a simple expression like "2 + 2" and see the result immediately:`,
